# Things I Do

### Community building
* I am a core member of <a href="http://golangbridge.org" target="_blank" title="gobridge">GoBridge</a> , a non-profit organization that focuses on programming education using Go: we work to ensure that groups of underrepresented people and people with limited access to technology have as much an opportunity to teach and learn Go as anyone else.</br>
* I host the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sdgophers/" target="_blank" title="sdgophers">North County San Diego Gophers meetup</a>. </br>
* I lead the <a href="http://twitter.com/womenwhogo_sd/" target="_blank" title="wwg sd">San Diego Women Who Go</a> chapter (and am looking for more women to join in the efforts.)
* I host informal networking events for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SD-Women-Who-Go/" target="_blank" title="meetup wwg sd">San Diego Women Who Go</a>. </br>

### Other things
* I play percurssion (caixa) with the San Diego <a href="http://www.sambasd.org/#!drummers/cfad" target="_blank" title="meetup wwg sd">Super Sonic Samba School</a>.</br>
* I have ran 2 half marathons. I can be found running along the beaches or lagoons in San Diego often.</br>
